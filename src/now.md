I've successfully closed on, and moved into, a new home. It has been a very stressful and time consuming process, but I'm extremely happy to be in my own place. I'm still unpacking, but slowly returning to normalcy. Hopefully my _Playing_, _Reading_, and _Learning_ sections will pick back up in activity as the Summer progresses. Between unpacking and preparing for a [triathlon relay](https://www.delmosports.com/events/escape-the-cape-new-jerseys-best-triathlon), it will probably be at least another month until I'm fully back into the swing of things.

I'm still doing [WeeklyBeats](https://weeklybeats.com) and have made 20 songs at this point. There have been some duds in the bunch, but I'm pretty happy with a few of them. My favorites are probably:

- [BOBENO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/bobeno) - A chiptune track inspired by my cat, Spool.
- [ATENTU](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/atentu) - Kind of chill track using samples from videos I recorded in Japan.
- [ONDO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/ondo) - Kind of chiptune track, made using the wavsynth on my m8. This was a pretty quick one, but ended up sounding way cooler than I originally expected.
- [CERBOLAVO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/cerbolavo-5) - Electronic club track I made while attending [PAX East](https://east.paxsite.com/) in March.
- [SAKURO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/sakuro-2) - Really interesting track inspired by the cherry blossoms that were blooming at the time.
- [FORIGI](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/forigi) - Probably only mentioning this because its my most recent submission, but like ONDO it was a quick one that turned out more interesting that I expected. This was also an interesting track in that I accidentally saved over a previous track that I was working on, so had to build a track last minute.

You might have noticed that all the tracks are named with a bit of a theme - they're all Esperanto words. While I haven't been actively practicing over the past few months, I have been using song titles as a way to play around with the language a bit. I've still been using my [M8](https://dirtywave.com/products/m8-tracker) for everything... but do plan to eventually use other software/tools ([nanoloop](https://www.nanoloop.com/), [LSDJ](https://www.littlesounddj.com), and [DefleMask](https://www.deflemask.com/)). I pre-ordered the [M8 Model:02](https://dirtywave.com/products/m8-tracker-model-02) in the first batch that went on sale, so that will be interesting to switch to in the next month as well.
