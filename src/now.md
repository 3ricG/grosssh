2025 is here... its been very cold and dry. The biggest update is that I
completed [WeeklyBeats 2024](https://weeklybeats.com/)! I'm shocked I
was able to do it, and I'm proud of the music I was able to make. It
wasn't the most amazing music; but it was in interesting way to get into
the habit of doing something creative, and it helped me build a flow and
familiarity with the synths and tools I used to make all the songs. It
was nice to not have a deadline for the first two weeks of the year, but
I do plan to make more music in 2025. I'll likely revisit a few of the
tracks that I made in 2024, and might put my favorites (remixed and
refreshed) into an album. I'm also working on some industrial music, but
no ETA on when that will actually be published anywhere. I need to look
at platforms like Bandcamp, Soundcloud, and others to figure out
how/when I would release music. And since WeeklyBeats is over, I'll
share one last song that I made - the final track,
[FINO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/fino). Since it was my last
song (and inspired by 
[OrangeDrink](https://weeklybeats.com/orangedrink/music/final-round)), 
I made a video for it using ffmpeg and shotcut:


<iframe style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dw7UY-VWj10?si=azUth3w7cgQgn7FT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Since that was such an important experience for 2024, I want to
eventually do a full write up about it; but I'll need some more time to
reflect on it. Maybe it'll be later this year, preparing for WeeklyBeats
2026.


Speaking of music, I recently joined a cooperative alternative to
Bandcamp, [Subvert](https://subvert.fm/). Its an interesting idea, and
one that I hope succeeds. If you know me and my music habits, you
probably know that I'm a heavy user of Bandcamp - my collection as of 
today has 1423 albums in it. I picked up heavily during COVID when they
started doing [Bandcamp Friday](https://isitbandcampfriday.com/), a day
when 100% of purchases went to the artists. I continued growing my
library to what it is today, and I still continue to buy albums there
because its still my platform of choice. It hasn't gotten to the point
where I'd abandon it, but in 2022 they were bought by Epic (the game
developer/publisher), and then in late 2023 they were bought again by
Songtradr. It's not clear what their plans for it will be; but it does
feel like things are up in the air, so a cooperative platform
alternative could be interesting. It will be soft launched later this
year, so I look forward to seeing how it plays out.


Outside of music, I'm planning some travel. Last year, I did the same
thing I've done most years and planned vacation poorly; using most of my
vacation time in the last two months of the year. This year, I'm
planning to (hopefully) go to Tuscany for a six day cycling tour with 
[inGamba](https://ingamba.pro/). The only place I've traveled outside of
the United States is Japan, so I'm excited to visit another new country.
The cycling tour is six days, but I will likely plan another ~week to
visit the area after cycling, if it makes sense. This will also be the
first time doing international solo travel... should be fun!


I'm also planning group travel... back to Japan üòÖ. This will be my
third trip; but unlike the last two times, this will be with a
relatively large group of friends instead of just one other person.
We're planning to go in Spring 2026, but we met up this month to start
planning. With a group this size (six to nine people), we definitely
need a bit more coordination. I also want to look at some places that
are a bit more off the beaten track. Having been to a lot of the major
tourist attractions, I want to try to dive a bit deeper and force myself
to be a bit more immersed. Because of this trip, I've stopped learning
Esperanto for the time indefinitely so that I can put a stronger focus
back on my Japanese studies. I've picked up the pace using
(Duolingo)[https://www.duolingo.com/course/ja/en/Learn-Japanese],
[WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/), and
[https://bunpro.jp/](https://bunpro.jp/) to refresh my existing
knowledge and start on some new grammar and kanji. Duolingo is
notoriously bad for Japanese; however, I will likely use it just for
some supplementary studying in addition to everything else. I also plan
to continue my lessons from university, using the Eleanor Harz Jorden
book [Japanese: The Spoken
Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese:_The_Spoken_Language),
along with [Genki](https://genki3.japantimes.co.jp/en/). I do not even
expect to be at N5 level by the time we go on the trip, but I do want to
feel a bit more confident than I did in my 2022 trip.


2024 was great, and 2025 has started off good so far - I'm hoping that
the rest of the year goes well!
