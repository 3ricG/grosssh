My _Playing_, _Reading_, and _Learning_ sections have taken a hit in the past few months as I've started the process of buying a house. Taking a lot of time prepping to move, and learning what it takes to actually buy a house. It's been a bit stressful, but I'll be happy to no longer pay rent! I've managed to still get a few hours into _Eastward_ since it's pretty easy to casually pick up and play. Sadly because of everything else, I haven't started a new PKD book yet; but did start _Memory's Legion_ in some of my spare time. Like _Eastward_, its fairly easy to pick up and read in short bursts since its a collection of short stories rather than a continuous story.

Even with everything else going on, I have somehow managed to keep up with [WeeklyBeats](https://weeklybeats.com)! I've written twelve songs, and started a 13th that needs a bit more work and better mixing; but so far no plans to stop. I've used my [M8](https://dirtywave.com/products/m8-tracker) for everything I've written so far, but I'm still planning to use [nanoloop](https://www.nanoloop.com/), [LSDJ](https://www.littlesounddj.com), and [DefleMask](https://www.deflemask.com/) at some point. While I've enjoyed the process, I think its still pretty apparent that my skills are a bit lacking. Once I get done with the home purchase and move, I want to dedicate some more focused time to learning mixing and mastering. I feel like that's the one thing that I'm really struggling with. All of the music I've written so far can be found here: <https://weeklybeats.com/mukti>
