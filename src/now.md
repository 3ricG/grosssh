A couple more months have passed, and the end of the year is getting
close. I'm much more settled into my home, but honestly still getting 
used to it... even though it's been over six months now. üòÖ

I started listening to an audiobook by Rick Rubin and decided to
include it in my _Reading_ section. Typically I wouldn't consider this
"reading" since it's almost equivalent to listening to a podcast or
something, but it's the most appropriate section for it on my Now page. 
I *would* like to read it rather than listen, but I've been so 
distracted and busy that I don't think I'll be able to sit down and add 
another book to my reading list. I haven't made a ton of progress 
through the other two in the past six months... üòê. I just started a 
week-long vacation and I'm not planning to go anywhere, so I am hoping 
to finish one of them during my time off. 

One of my favorite games as a kid was re-released a few weeks back, and
it's consumed a bunch of my time in the past week. Dragon Quest III
(originally Dragon Warrior III when I played it on my GameBoy Color) was
released as an HD-2D remaster in a style similar to Octopath Traveler or
Triangle Strategy. Besides the graphical improvements, there are a bunch
of quality-of-life updates that make the game slightly easier, some
combat changes, and a few new cutscenes, voiceovers, classes, weapons,
and enemies. Overall it's been tons of fun to revisit the game, and it's a
great remake that's gotten tons of great
reviews^[<https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/>]. 

Since it's December, there are only FOUR MORE WEEKS of
[WeeklyBeats](http://weeklybeats.com) 2024. It is crazy that it's almost
over, and also crazy to me that I've been able to keep up with it. I've
made it so far, so I'm hoping that I can finish strong and make a few
more good tracks! After my last Now page update, I had a string of
tracks that I think were really good, including my favorite track that I
made for WeeklyBeats, FLUO. I'll link a few of my favorites since the
beginning of October:

- [BATI](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/bati-3) - A pretty upbeat
  DnB track using samples of Roy Batty in Blade Runner (1982). I think
the overall mix and theme worked out well on this one.
- [MIZERA](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/mizera-4) - Creepy, kinda
sci-fi/horror-themed Halloween track. A little unsettling, and reused
some elements from my earlier track, 
[TERURA](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/terura).
- [FLUO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/fluo-4) - Arguably the best
  track I've made for WeeklyBeats. A bit of a techno, trance, eurobeat
track that has really good energy and a pretty catchy "chorus" synth.
What's most shocking is that I almost accidentally came up with this
track while playing around on my M8 as I was falling asleep!
- [KIRLI](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/kirli) - Another
  techno/club track that was made pretty quickly, and turned out better
than I expected. Some of the sounds are a bit off, but the overall vibe
of the track was pretty good and it was pretty well received.
- [DRAKO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/drako) - Including this
  one since I just released it this week. Since I've been caught up
playing Dragon Quest 3 all week, I decided to sample it (an idea from my
brother) and build a track using some sounds from the new and old games.
Fought a bit with levels and my typical compressor settings, so there 
are some odd sounds and ducking, but overall it's a pretty fun track.

I'm hoping to remix some of my 2024 WeeklyBeats tracks in 2025, and
hopefully make them into fuller-sounding, and better tracks. I may
release them as a (free/pay-what-you-want) album in 2025 if I think
they're good enough. I've continued using my [DirtyWave
M8](https://dirtywave.com/products/m8-tracker-model-02) for all of my
tracks. I wrote a long post about the M8 in October, and attempted
to provide some info and tips that could be useful for people just
learning about the device - [you can check it out
here](http://gross.sh/m8).

I originally planned to use some more synths and instruments for
WeeklyBeats; but based on timing and how much fun I've had with my M8, 
I haven't  used anything else for my tracks. I may experiment more after
the year is over. Since I now have a year's worth of weekly music 
creation, I want to experiment more with my other synths -

2024 has been an interesting year, to say the least. Hope it ends on a
high note!
