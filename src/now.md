Currently finding myself super interested in Philip K. Dick's books. I probably watched Blade Runner at least five times in 2023, so thought I should finally read _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_, and I really enjoyed it. Followed it up with _Ubik_ and just started _Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said_. His books are super easy to read, and I love his style, so I'll probably continue reading more of his books throughout the year.

My music production skills are pretty poor, but I decided to participate in [WeeklyBeats](https://weeklybeats.com) this year to work on improving that. I also wanted to push myself to use my [M8](https://dirtywave.com/products/m8-tracker) more and actually complete some songs on it. Since I got it, I've only really played around and built bits and pieces of songs; but WeeklyBeats has already improved my ability to use it in the first month of partipation. I'm hoping to also write some songs using [nanoloop](https://www.nanoloop.com/) (either my nanoloop one, or the Android app), LSDJ, and DefleMask. There's still 48 weeks left!
