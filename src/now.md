Almost five months into the new location, and I'm still trying to sort out how I want things and where things should go. After being at my previous place for around five years, I had forgotten how long it took to get into normal habits and patterns at my place. I haven't made any major changes or modifications yet because I want to live here longer before I decide to make changes. If I'm not sure how I want things five months in, I don't want to make a change that I'm going to want to change in another five months!

My _Playing_, _Reading_, and _Learning_ sections didn't make a ton of progress through Summer, but I have lopped some things of the list and added some others. I have picked my Êó•Êú¨Ë™û studies back up again. Its only duolingo, but I'm doing it regularly enough that I think I'll get back into the habit, then switch to more traditional study methods - [Heisig Kanji study method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi), [Genki](https://genki3.japantimes.co.jp/en/) workbooks, and the [Jorden and Noda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese:_The_Spoken_Language) spoken and written language books. I have considered looking for language share groups or more traditional classes, but haven't invested a ton of time into it yet. I'm not going to plan too far ahead until I really get back into the swing of things.

Today is the 75% mark for [WeeklyBeats](https://weeklybeats.com). Having never released music before, I'm shocked that I've been able to keep up and release a new track for 39 weeks in a row. I said it before... there are definitely some duds in the bunch, but the fact that I still made new songs, mixed, and released them is really cool to me. Hoping nothing prevents me from completing all 52 weeks! I listed some of my favorite tracks in previous posts, so I'll add some of my favories since my last post (6/14):

- [TERURA](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/terura) - This may have been my most popular track so far. A bit of a sci-fi horror track, utilizing deep choral vocals and buzzing synths to make a bit of a 3TEETH meets SyFy B-movie vibe. I really liked it, but I definitely could have worked on the musical qualities of the buzzing synths a bit more.
- [SORCO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/sorco) - One of my favorite tracks from the whole project, this was another attempt at a magical, sci-fi track. I pulled quotes from the [CCRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetic_Culture_Research_Unit) writings to build on the sci-fi aspect, and redered the vocals using an old vocal synthesys program called [Festival](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/). I think the [GLaDOS-esq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLaDOS) monotone vocals mixed with the topic of the lyrics to make a really cool track.
- [SCIAS](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/scias-3) - Originally I did not like this track at all, and felt like it was a bit too plain/basic. Over time, its grown on me and the topic mixed with the soft electronic synths fit with the vibe of the music I was listening to the week I wrote it ([Porter Robinson - SMILE! :D](https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/87964290-66b9-4fd9-bea3-1bfe9de92862)).
- [BOBENO TRI](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/bobeno-tri-2) - The third Spool themed track, and its chiptune again! There's a funny easter egg at the end that you can see if you look through the post; I embeded an image of Spool in the audio. While it doesn't musically add anything to the track, I thought it was funny to include.
- [MINACI](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/minaci-2) - Might only be posting this one because its on my mind, but this is my latest track. I went back to using [Festival](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/) for vocals, but this time put together some quotes from the Philip K. Dick book [_Ubik_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik). I think the overall vibe of this track was pretty cool, and the lyrics worked well with the backing beat. This type of track is driving me to look into vocal synthesis a bit more, and I want to see what else I can do with computer generated voices.

I have been using my [M8 Model:02](https://dirtywave.com/products/m8-tracker-model-02), since I got it a few months back, and it is LEAGUES better than the Model:01. While the software was great on the original (its the same as Model:02), the hardware improvements add major workflow and usage improvements. Just to name the biggest - there's a built in mic for quick sampling, a larger screen, and larger battery. The larger battery is honestly the best improvement; I feel like I never have to charge it anymore. I still plan to write a post about how I use my M8 and some of the undocumented (or not officially documented) features and behaviors of the device. 

Summer was busy but fun, looking forward to the Fall and Winter!
