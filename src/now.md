I've successfully closed on, and moved into, a new home. It has been a very stressful and time consuming process, but I'm extremely happy to be in my own place. I'm still unpacking, but slowly returning to normalcy. Hopefully my _Playing_, _Reading_, and _Learning_ sections will pick back up in activity as the Summer progresses. Between unpacking and preparing for a [triathlon relay](https://www.delmosports.com/events/escape-the-cape-new-jerseys-best-triathlon), it will probably be at least another month until I'm fully back into the swing of things. On the bright side, prepping for the triathlon relay paid off, and we came in first for the "sprint" distance!

I'm still doing [WeeklyBeats](https://weeklybeats.com) and have made 20 songs at this point. There have been some duds in the bunch, but I'm pretty happy with a few of them. My favorites are probably:

- [BOBENO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/bobeno) - A chiptune track inspired by my cat, Spool.
- [ATENTU](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/atentu) - Kind of chill track using samples from videos I recorded in Japan.
- [ONDO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/ondo) - Kind of chiptune track, made using the wavsynth on my m8. This was a pretty quick one, but ended up sounding way cooler than I originally expected.
- [CERBOLAVO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/cerbolavo-5) - Electronic club track I made while attending [PAX East](https://east.paxsite.com/) in March.
- [SAKURO](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/sakuro-2) - Really interesting track inspired by the cherry blossoms that were blooming at the time.
- [FORIGI](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/forigi) - Like ONDO this was a quick one that turned out more interesting that I expected. It was also an interesting track in that I accidentally saved over a previous track that I was working on, so had to build a track last minute.
- [BOBENO DU](https://weeklybeats.com/mukti/music/bobeno-du) - Not the greatest track, but had to include the second/follow up Spool-themed track!

You might have noticed that all the tracks are named with a bit of a theme - they're all Esperanto words. While I haven't been actively practicing over the past few months, I have been using song titles as a way to play around with the language a bit. I've still been using my [M8](https://dirtywave.com/products/m8-tracker) for everything... but do plan to eventually use other software/tools ([nanoloop](https://www.nanoloop.com/), [LSDJ](https://www.littlesounddj.com), and [DefleMask](https://www.deflemask.com/)). I just received my [M8 Model:02](https://dirtywave.com/products/m8-tracker-model-02), and BOBENO DU was the first track I made using it. It's a nice improvement over the Model:01, most notably because of the larger screen and battery. I think I'll eventually make a page on this site to list out some tips and things I've learned about the M8 as I've used it over the past few months doing WeeklyBeats.
