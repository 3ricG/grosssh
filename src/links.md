# LINKS {.green}

This is mainly a dump of random links I reference, send to people often,
plan to look into later, [or that I think are important to link
to](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/). 
I'll occasionally add notes about the links, and will try to classify 
them a bit.

### 🌐 Small Web {.green}
- [Marginalia Search](https://search.marginalia.nu/) - Probably my 
favorite 'small web' search engine.
- [Plain Text Sports](https://plaintextsports.com/)

### 🌎 Big Web {.green}
- [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) - A decent search engine that 
can be used as a replacement 
for Google. Results are similar, but with (hopefully) less tracking.

### 🔌 Tech {.green}
- [Keychrom Q10](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q10-alice-layout-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard) - 
My favorite keyboard, a 75% Alice layout with QMK firmware.

### 📚 Reference {.green}
- [Hacker Laws](https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws)

### 🎼 Music {.green}
- [Dirtywave M8 Manual](https://dirtywave.com/pages/resources-downloads)
- [Mega FM Manual](https://www.twistedelectrons.com/downloads-firmware)
- [Reaper DAW](https://www.reaper.fm/)
